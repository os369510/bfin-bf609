Customize u-boot config

Buildroot will needs some modification to fix build errors

1. Use buildroot.config as .config
This config is base on bf609-ezkit_config and then remove some deprecated
packages

2. Unescaped left brace in regex is illegal here in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/\${ <-- HERE ([^ \t=:+{}]+)}/ at /home/jeremysu/adi-buildroot-code/output/host/usr/bin/automake line 4159.
Fix: use "\{" instead of "{"
